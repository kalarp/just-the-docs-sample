# Make sure the power is turned off.

This is a good idea any time you are messing around with electrical fixtures. Why not be safe?

* Just switch the red power button to “off” in your fuse box. Be aware this will shut off all of your power, not just for one fixture.
* You should also unplug the lighting fixture before you change the light bulb (if it's a fixture with a plug, that is). If you don't, you could risk getting shocked. Always be careful around electricity.
