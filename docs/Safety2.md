# Take other safety measures.

There are a few things you should keep in mind, especially if the bulb is high up in the ceiling.

* Let the bulb cool off before you unscrew it. If the light was on recently, the bulb will be hot to the touch, and you could burn your fingers.
* If the bulb is in a ceiling fixture, don't try to balance on an unsteady chair or something similar. Use a sturdy stepladder. That way you can reach the light bulb without falling.
* Instead of a step ladder, you can buy a special extension tool to switch a light bulb that is very high up. This is often safer than trying to climb a ladder. And remember: You could always hire a handyman! You shouldn't need any other tools to change a light bulb in a lamp fixture.
