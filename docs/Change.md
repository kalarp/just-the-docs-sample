## Put a new bulb in the socket.

In order to put a new bulb into a lighting fixture's socket, you will want to turn the bulb in a clockwise direction. Just remember: counter-clockwise to remove; clockwise to insert.

* The bulb might lock into place or you might have to twist it a bit until you can't twist it anymore. This will depend on the socket. Don't screw the bulb too tight or it could break. If you have a bayonet bulb, you will need to align the bulb's base with the two pins. Push down and then twist upwards, using a clockwise motion.
* In the case of a screw cap bulb, simply place it into the hole and then twist it. You will usually want to choose a bulb that has the same wattage as the old bulb, unless you want softer or brighter light than what you already had.
* Check the label on the bulb socket or fixture for the max watt/amp rating. Make sure the bulb's power rating doesn't exceed that allowed by your lighting fixture (check with the manufacturer or packaging).
* Turn the switch on so you can know when to stop turning. When the light turns on, stop turning.
