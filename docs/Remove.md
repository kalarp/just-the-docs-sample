## Take the bulb out of the socket.

If the fixture is easy to reach, such as a lamp, the process is pretty straightforward. Sockets do differ depending on your lighting fixture.

  * If you have a bayonet mount, which is common in the UK and places like New Zealand, hold the bulb gently but firmly, and then push down and turn the bulb counter-clockwise. This should release it from the socket. This type of socket has two prongs.
  * If the socket has a screw fitting, which is common in America and throughout Europe, you should gently twist the bulb counter clockwise. It should then come loose from the socket, and you can remove it.
  * If the bulb detaches from the screw, then you will need to use a pair of pliers to remove the screw. Make sure that the power is off then unscrew the screw.
